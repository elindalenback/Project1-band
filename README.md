## Design

### Colour Scheme

I have chosen my colors to evoke a sense of the band and optimize the user experience and accessibility. The colors I've used are listed below, along with their respective placements.

- #000000 & #ffffff are used for the sites text.
- #31572c, #fe654f & # dce2aa are the main colors I have chosen, using them rotationally for backgrounds and headings.
- The green color is also used for buttons - going from shades dark to light.
- #fe654f is used in the band name logo to make a bold first impression. It is also used in the nav and icons for social media icons in footer.

Additionally, I've extracted the blue color from the header picture to maintain consistency across the music and tour pages, as well as in the footer, ensuring a cohesive overall styling.
