## Design

### Colour Scheme

I have chosen my colors to evoke a sense of the band and optimize the user experience and accessibility. The colors I've used are listed below, along with their respective placements.

- #000000 & #ffffff are used for the sites text.
- #31572c, #fe654f & # dce2aa are the main colors I have chosen, using them rotationally for backgrounds and headings.
- The green color is also used for buttons - going from shades dark to light.
- #fe654f is used in the band name logo to make a bold first impression. It is also used in the nav and icons for social media icons in footer.

Additionally, I've extracted the blue color (#baf0f9) from the header picture to maintain consistency across the music and tour pages, as well as in the footer, ensuring a cohesive overall styling.

### Typography

*Google Fonts fas used to import the fonts.*

For the Band Name Logo in the header, I opted for the 'Lobster Two' font with a fallback of sans-serif for versatility. This choice is consistently extended to the band members section and the 'Thank you' message in the feedback.html page. This intentional selection aims to emphasize a direct and cohesive visual connection with the essence of the band throughout the website.

For the body text, I've implemented the sans-serif font 'Montserrat.' I chose a sans-serif font as it enhances readability on screens. The fallback font in this case is, of course, sans-serif, ensuring a consistent and visually pleasing presentation across various devices.
